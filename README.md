## Fetch Data and show these data using API
# Week - 4 : Homework - 2 - Simpra IOS Bootcamp

   First of all, We have three ViewController and one navigationController.The first navigation controller is the management of screens, Second View   is the starting page to get data, and the Third view controller is the screen showing data. My data are about cars. When you press on the car you can show a detail of that car. In my project, I used a Postman to analyse data. When I am sure to come data, I use this data in my application.
